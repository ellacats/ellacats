### something from me
Hello! My name is lijiayi. I'm a student majoring in computer and technology from JMU. My hobbies are reading and listening to music. As a quiet girl, I always prefer to alone but sometimes like to speak to others. Because defferent people have interesting ideas which may broaden my horizon.
Nice to meet you!
